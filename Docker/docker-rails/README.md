# docker-rails

This is a rails app configured to use postgresql as its database. 

To bring up the app simply run `docker-compose up`. 

You can browse the app on `http://localhost:3000`

To bring the app down run `docker-compose down`.

This is still WIP, I shall update the app to an estore like in my earlier trainings on microservices. 

Then I shall transform it to a more SOA model of operation from the current monolithic format and make use of Docker and Docker-Compose.
